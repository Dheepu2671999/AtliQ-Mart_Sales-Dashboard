## Background

AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.  

## Data Sources

The data used for the analysis is taken from AtliQ Mart's internal databases. The tables used include fact_events, dim_products, dim_stores, and dim_campaigns. These tables contain information about product sales, store locations, promotional events, and campaign revenues.

## Conclusion
